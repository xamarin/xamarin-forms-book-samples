"Mr. Sherlock Holmes, who was usually very late in
the mornings, save upon those not infrequent
occasions when he was up all night, was seated at
the breakfast table. I stood upon the hearth-rug
and picked up the stick which our visitor had left
behind him the night before. It was a fine, thick
piece of wood, bulbous-headed, of the sort which
is known as a &#x201C;Penang lawyer.&#x201D; Just
under the head was a broad silver band, nearly an
inch across, &#x201C;To James Mortimer, M.R.C.S.,
from his friends of the C.C.H.,&#x201D; was engraved
upon it, with the date &#x201C;1884.&#x201D; It was
just such a stick as the old-fashioned family
practitioner used to carry&#x2014;dignified, solid,
and reassuring." />
